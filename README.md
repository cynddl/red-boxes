# red-boxes.be

_Belgian red letterboxes: you never know where they are and when they get serviced. Now thereâ€™s an app that tells you._

This is the source code for http://red-boxes.be, a simple, intuitive web app to locate the closest postal box in Belgium, along with information on collection time (during the week and during the weekend). To read more about the project, please go to our [blog post about the project](http://i.liketightpants.net/and/finding-red-letterboxes-in-belgium).
